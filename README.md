# VIRTUAL-MEMORY-MANAGER
  
## Designing a Virtual Memory Manager  
### OS PROJECT FOR 4TH SEMESTER  
This project consists of writing a program that translates logical to physical addresses for a virtual address space of size 216 = 65,536 bytes. Your program will read from a file containing logical addresses and, using a TLB as well as a page table, will translate each logical address to its corresponding physical address and output the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address. The goal behind this project is to simulate the steps involved in translating logical to physical addresses.
